    Number used as logic:                    1,142 out of  92,152    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             922
      Number using O5 output only:              58
      Number using O5 and O6:                  162
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      6
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         6
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   407 out of  23,038    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,188
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           823 out of   1,188   69%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  40 out of   1,188    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         325 out of   1,188   27%
    Number of unique control sets:              49
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             228 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
