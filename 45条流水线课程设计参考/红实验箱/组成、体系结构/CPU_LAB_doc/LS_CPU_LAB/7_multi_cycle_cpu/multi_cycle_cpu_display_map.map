    Number used as logic:                    2,975 out of  92,152    3%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,215
      Number using O5 output only:              86
      Number using O5 and O6:                  674
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     12
      Number with same-slice register load:      5
      Number with same-slice carry load:         7
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,064 out of  23,038    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,120
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,866 out of   3,120   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 133 out of   3,120    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,121 out of   3,120   35%
    Number of unique control sets:              57
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             260 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
