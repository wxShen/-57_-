      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     14
      Number with same-slice register load:      6
      Number with same-slice carry load:         8
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,308 out of  23,038    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,822
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,271 out of   3,822   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 215 out of   3,822    5%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,336 out of   3,822   34%
    Number of unique control sets:              69
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             309 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
